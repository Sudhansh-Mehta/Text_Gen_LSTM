# Text_Gen_LSTM
Text_Generation with LSTM Networks:
Trained a neural net to drive a virtual driving simulator,
using data recorded from own manual operation of the simulator (Udacity Simulator).
Model attempts to predict the correct steering angle, given the input
images, using own recorded laps as training data(frames from the training data).
